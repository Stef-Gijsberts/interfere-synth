# Introduction
<!-- Give a general description of your system. For example, what are the
goals of the system? Who are the users of the system? Why are they interested
in using this system? -->
This project report describes *Interfere*, a digital musical instrument.

Musicians can use Interfere in their Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). Such a
computer progam is like a digital atelier for music, where instruments and effects
can be easily found and used.

# Description

## Properties
<!-- Global description of the product and its properties. Although this is a
global description, it is important that you try to describe the properties
explicitly. So do not accept any implicit assumptions. The description can be
illustrated with information about the user interface, for example
screenshots or other illustrative information.-->

## Product Justification
<!-- Here you explain why it is worthwhile to build your system. What other
(similar) products are available? What are the typical (new and innovative)
contributions of your system? -->

## Specifications
<!-- A more detailed description of the properties mentioned in section 2.1.
It would be good to give some underlying models, for example Use Case
Diagrams with an explanatory description. -->

# Design

## Global Design
<!-- Describe the components (modules) of your system and the
interconnections between those components. You should explicitly describe the
role of each component. Explain why the components together actually do what
they are supposed to do. Make sure that this distinction between the
components is in line with the way in which you implemented the system. -->
Interfere is divided into two parts: the *supplier* and the *dealer*.

## Detailed Design
<!-- Give a detailed design in terms of data structures and algorithms, for
example the classes, methods and attributes. Explain the idea behind the most
important methods and attributes. Make sure that your descriptions are clear
and consistent, such that a future programmer would be able to further
improve or extend the system. -->

## Design Justification
<!-- Explain why your design is a good design. Here you should focus on your
design decisions including technical details. Give possible design
alternatives and describe how you chose between these alternatives. -->

# Evaluation
<!-- Here you should evaluate your project, for example: are you satisfied
with your product? What are the unsolved issues? Are you satisfied with your
development process (that is the process which resulted in your product)?

What did you learn? Describe and analyse the factors which determined your
process and product. What are the consequences for future work? How would you
operate in a future project?
